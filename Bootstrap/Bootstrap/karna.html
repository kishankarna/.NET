                        This is one of the robust computer program in todays era..James Gosling, who created the Java programming
                        language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an "imitation"
                        of Java; Gosling further said that "[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted."
                        [20][21] Klaus Kreft and Angelika Langer (authors of a C++ streams book) stated in a blog post that "Java and
                        C# are almost identical programming languages. Boring repetition that lacks innovation,"[22] "Hardly anybody
                        will claim that Java or C# are revolutionary programming languages that changed the way we write programs,"
                        and "C# borrowed a lot from Java - and vice versa. Now that C# supports boxing and unboxing, we'll have a
                        very similar feature in Java."[23] In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that C# is "not a Java clone" and is "much
                        closer to C++" in its design

                    Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[15]
                    and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application
                    developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
                    support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that
                    can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most
                    popular programming languages in use,[18][19][20][21] particularly for client-server web applications, with a
                    reported 9 million developers.[22] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
                    (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java
                    platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

            Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design
            and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the
            systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures
            (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access
            to, information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic
            processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems
